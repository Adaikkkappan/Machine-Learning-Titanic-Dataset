# Machine-Learning-Titanic-Dataset

### Introduction

- The original Titanic dataset, describing the survival status of individual passengers on the Titanic. The titanic data does not contain information from the crew, but it does contain actual ages of half of the passengers. 
- The principal source for data about Titanic passengers is the Encyclopaedia Titanic. The datasets used here were begun by a variety of researchers. One of the original sources is Eaton & Haas (1994) Titanic: Triumph and Tragedy, Patrick Stephens Ltd, which includes a passenger list created by many researchers and edited by Michael A. Findlay.
- Thomas Cason of UVa has greatly updated and improved the titanic data frame using the Encyclopaedia Titanic and created the dataset here. Now the titanic data was downloaded and used from the Kaggle website (Author Name: BRENDA N). 
- Some Categorial features have been changed to continuous features, many errors corrected, many missing ages filled in.


### Objective:

- Our objective is to Examine the below points,
- Examine the percentage of the male passenger survived vs female passenger.
- Examine which class of passenger having the highest no. of survived count.
- Examine which Embarked having the highest no. of survived count.
- Find the overall accuracy of the titanic dataset.

### Tools:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib 
- Seaborn
- sklearn

### Conclusion:

- We can able to achive our objectives.

### Notes:

- For more detailed explanation and implementation methods, please refer the document (Machine Learning by using Random Forest-Titanic Dataset.pdf) with in this Machine-Learning-Titanic-Dataset Repositry.
